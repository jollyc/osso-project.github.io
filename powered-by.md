## Rocana

[Rocana][rocana], the digital transformation company, uses Osso to represent all
event data in Rocana Ops, its flagship product. Rocana's agent, APIs, log4j
appender, and other sources turn log messages, statsd samples, Netflow and IPFIX
flows, syslog events, and other data streams into Osso events. These events are
collected by Kafka and processed into events that can be queried and analyzed
within Rocana Ops. Events can also be routed to third-party systems (as Osso
events) for specialized processing and analytics. For a more complete
description of the architecture and how Rocana uses Osso, see [this presentation
by Eric Sammer from Big Data Day LA 2016][rocana-sammer-video].
